### avoidance

a landscape of bots, each one moving one step at a time in a particular direction

when a bot encounters another bot or the boundaries of the landscape, it pivots right and proceeds

if there is nowhere for the bot to go, it goes nowhere

every time a bot avoids another bot, it dies a little inside

#### todo:
  - user can choose the lifespan of the bot (how many interactions can it have before dying)
  - user can reset animation
  - user can specify number of bots to start with
  - keys/indicators displayed somewhere
